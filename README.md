## Description
Do you ever want a channel to play in the background without having to use your internet data? Or do you ever wish that streaming services had a feature that would rotate through different shows instead of playing 8 straight hours of *How I Met Your Mother*? Or are you sick of your cableprovider or antenna playing shows you don't want to watch with a crap ton of commercial breaks? Or do you have a lot of shows on a hard drive you never watch because it requires walking to your desk to get it?

Well look no further!

This personalized channel will play *your* shows that *you* want to watch. With your shows, it has the option of playing nostalgic commercials that you provide it to get the real TV experience that you want!
